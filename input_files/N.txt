the sky misses the sun at night
The toast jumped out of the toaster
The Sea lashed out in anger at the ships unwilling to tolerate another battle
The sun greeted me this morning
The sky was full of dancing stars
The radio stopped singing and stared at me
The sun played hide and seek with the clouds
