the sky misses the sun at night
The toast jumped out of the toaster
The Sea lashed out in anger at the ships unwilling to tolerate another battle
The sun greeted me this morning
The sky was full of dancing stars
The radio stopped singing and stared at me
The sun played hide and seek with the clouds
the sky was so low that if you reached up you could touch it with your fingers
the sky began to choke with all the dust that the old woman was causing with her sweeping
the sky gave another huge sneeze and jumped out of her way
